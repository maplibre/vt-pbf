# Contributing

Thanks for getting involved and contributing to vt-pbf. Below are a few things to keep in mind when submitting a PR.

* If adding new functionality, consider adding tests for it! Run the unit tests locally: `npm run test-unit`.
* Make sure you run the linter and address any issues: `npm run lint`.
* We're using rollup to bundle releases, run `npm run build` to create a new release inside `dist/`.
